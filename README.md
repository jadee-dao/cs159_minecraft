# Wayfarer

We introduce ${Wayfarer}$, an innovative LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft that excels at zero-shot generalization, automatic curriculum generation, and prompt efficiency. ${Wayfarer}$ leverages an automatic curriculum driven by GPT-4o to maximize exploration and task completion using a flexible controller framework, ${MineWire}$. ${Wayfarer}$ employs high-level task planning and tree-like decision-making, enabling it to achieve complex crafting goals with minimal computational expense. This approach significantly reduces token usage and costs, allowing ${Wayfarer}$ to craft a diamond pickaxe for mere cents. Our agent's capabilities are further enhanced by its ability to interpret and execute tasks dynamically, adapting to new environments and challenges on-the-fly.  Wayfarer demonstrates exceptional proficiency in Minecraft, achieving tech tree milestones and zero-shot crafting in cosistently less iterations than existing SOTA.
